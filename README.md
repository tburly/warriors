### warriors
---

This started as a fun OOP Python exercise taken out from this **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE)** in **[the excellent Derek Banas' YT programming course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwjAHQERL08&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt)** and since then has grown considerably.

I strive to realistically simulate a fight of two quasi-medieval warriors as much as it can be done using fairly simple, RPG-influenced mechanics. Of course, this *realistically* is constrained by how I see it, which probably isn't very factual.

I sticked to d20 rolls and corresponding range of numbers, because that's what I felt most familiar with.

Read the **[core_mechanics.md](https://github.com/tburly/warriors/blob/master/core_mechanics.md)** for a comprehensive write-up of planned and already implemented mechanics.
